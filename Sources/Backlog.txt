Issue (proposals):
Social network integration


CMS USER MODULE

1. Authentication and authorzation
Implement schedule to retrive actual user info. It means that user data is ment obsolete in for example 5 minutes. We can have case when super admin edited an admin 
membership data and updated his roles but the admin was working. In this case we must rdirect the user to login page. See comments in CMSControllerBase.OnAuthorization



GALLERY MODULE

1 Filter copied files during gallery creation
Some gallery template specific files are copied into gallery output (cover). We must filter files

2. Gallery zip package creation for downloading
For the time being file/folder filtering is not implemeted. It means all files and folders (system temporaries are included) are added into the archive
